   "## 译文及剖析\n",
   "\n",
   "> Once home to fishermen and farmers, modern Hong Kong is a teeming, commercially-vibrant metropolis where Chinese and Western influences fuse.\n",
   "\n",
   "> \n",
   "\n",
   "> 曾经是渔村和农村的香港，现在是一个充满商业活力的大都市，也是中西方文化交汇的地方。\n",
   "\n",
   "* commercially没有翻译出来。\n",
   "\n",
   "* influence没有翻译出来。\n",
   "\n",
   "* 另外“渔村和农村”的说法有点奇怪，中文惯用的说法一般是“香港过去住着渔民和农民，现在则是……”。\n",
   "\n",
   "> The former British colony became a special administrative region of China in 1997, when Britain’s 99-year lease of the New Territories, north of Hong Kong island, expired.\n",
   "\n",
   "> \n",
   "\n",
   "> 1997年，英国对香港岛北部，新界的99年租约过期，这个曾经的英国殖民地成为了中国的特别行政区。\n",
   "\n",
   "* 这个句子的结构太零散，完全不像中文。\n",
   "\n",
   "* 新界是在香港岛北面，与港岛是分离的，不是“香港岛北部”，这大概因为译者缺乏必要的地理知识。\n",
   "\n",
   "> Hong Kong is governed under the principle of “one country, two systems” under which China has agreed to give the region a high degree of autonomy and to preserve its economic and social systems for 50 years from the date of the handover.\n",
   "\n",
   "> \n",
   "\n",
   "> 在一国两制的原则下，中国同意香港高度自治，并且自交接之日起，保持经济政治制度50年不变。\n",
   "\n",
   "* 两个under的结构没有弄清楚，第一个是指港岛按照“一国两制”的原则治理，第二个是中国对“一国两制”的理解和保证；\n",
   "\n",
   "* “一国两制”是专有说法，需要引号。\n",
   "\n",
   "* “经济政治制度”有违中文习惯，一般说“政治经济制度”。\n",
   "\n",
   "> Hong Kong’s constitution, the Basic Law, provides for the development of democratic processes.\n",
   "\n",
   ">\n",
   "\n",
   "> 香港的宪法－基本法，给民主进程提供了发展。\n",
   "\n",
   "* the Basic Law原文都是大写，应当翻译为全名《香港特别行政区基本法》，或简称《基本法》。\n",
   "\n",
   "* provides for不是provides，前者意思是“为xx做准备”，后者意思是“提供”。\n",
   "\n",
   "> China controls Hong Kong’s foreign and defence policies, but the territory has its own currency and customs status.\n",
   "\n",
   "> \n",
   "\n",
   "> 虽然中国控制着香港的外交和国防政策，但是她保有自己的货币和海关。\n",
   "\n",
   "* 这里的“她”指代不明，前后的主语发生了变化。最好改为“虽然香港的外交和国防政策……，但是有自己的货币和海关”。\n",
   "\n",
   "## 总评\n",
   "\n",
   "这也是一篇简短的新闻报道，并没有太多的复杂含义。不过相对其他新闻报道，本文中出现了一些专有名词，比如“基本法”和“一国两制”，这是翻译时要特别关注的。\n",
   "\n",
   "而且如果译者不熟悉这类报道涉及的背景知识，一定要查证，这样就不会出现“新界是港岛北部”的错误。\n",
   "\n",
   "译文出现了一些“照搬原文”的句子，欧化的味道很重，最典型的例子就是“1997年，英国对香港岛北部，新界的99年租约过期，这个曾经的英国殖民地成为了中国的特别行政区”。\n",
